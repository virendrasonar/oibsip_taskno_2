        <h2>About MSD</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and former captain of the Indian national cricket team.
          He is regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen in the history of cricket as well as the best finisher.
          He was captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014,
          who plays right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman, known for his calm and composed demeanor on the field and his ability to finish matches with his powerful batting.
          He captained the Indian cricket team from 2007 to 2016, leading them to numerous victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20,
          the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.
          Apart from his achievements in international cricket, Dhoni also played for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL)
          and led them to five IPL titles in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023. Throughout his career, Dhoni has shown immense self-confidence and belief in his own abilities, which has translated into success on the cricket field.
          He has often been praised for his never-give-up attitude and the ability to lead his team to victory against all odds. Dhoni always believed that the process 
          is more important than results. He is a genius mastermind and the fastest wicketkeeper behind the wicket. Even though he has achieved so much in terms of achievements, money, and fame, 
          he is still a very humble, down-to-earth guy and a great human being.
